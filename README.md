# Summary
This project serves to be my personal portfolio for photography. Both film and digital photos will be hosted here, as well as a blog, and ways to contact me for work.
It also serves as a second project to get me versed with Next.js and Tailwind.
Personally, I believe having a website, and by extension having complete control over how your art is viewed is important. This serves as my way to allow my work to be viewed in the way I wish it to be. Hopefully my work strikes chords with you!  # Summary
